# _Welcome to the Savvy Coders Blog_

As a part of a growing tech ecosystem in St. Louis and Nashville (and across the country), Savvy Coders is proud to introduce our weekly blog to help you stay up-to-date with local and national tech trends. Featuring contributions from Tanya Yatzek on the latest technology hiring trends and personal stories, from Alex Pearson with specific tutorials and glimpses into the Savvy Coders classroom, and from Elaine Queathem on where Savvy Coders is going.

Articles should be published on a weekly basis on a variety of topics. If there's something you'd like to see us talk about, be sure to let us know on twitter [@SavvyCoders](https://twitter.com/savvycoders) or in the comment section below.

Thanks for taking the time to follow this blog, support our classes, and help introduce more people to the languages of the web!
