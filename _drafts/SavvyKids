 +  Elaine Queathem, Founder and CEO of [Savvy Coders](http://savvycoders.com), a startup that teaches front end software development skills to anyone with the desire to learn, was getting so many questions from adult students about how to help their kids learn to code, that she put a program together called SavvyKids. She said,  "Providing kids with technical skills early on gives them really valuable and portable skills as they continue through the K-12 educational system, and might also give them a true alternative to the post-secondary school model of the traditional four year college degree."
 +   
 +  Savvy Kids is a new, seven-week program for 10-13 year-olds that introduces the fun of creating web graphics, the discipline of planning a design project, and the satisfaction of putting it all together with an entrepreneurial twist. Martin Holloway, a Design student in St. Louis and SavvyCoders intern, worked with Queathem to design the program based on his experience working with kids at a design camp focused on photography and digital art. "At the Design Academy Summer Camp it, It was my first introduction to working with young people and sharing my passions and really receiving it back. I've been doing this since I could first pick up a pencil, and then just to be able to share your passion with other people that want to learn about it--it was awesome. Having had that experience, I could see how it could really transition to a coding class."
 +   
 +  Once Queathem and Holloway had the curriculum finalized, they hosted a focus group in December of 2016 to gauge how real kids would respond to the program. Holloway said, "We tried to get them to understand the concept of brainstorming. Make them understand that what you see on the computer all starts up here (in your head). It just doesn't magically happen. You can create an idea, and from there you can follow steps through graphic design and design the graphics that you want on your website. Once you learn some of the more technical skills for the coding, you can plug the graphics in and you can have a beautiful website."

 +   
 +  Queathem felt strongly that whatever the program would be, it had to be fun and it had to be something the kids would really have interest in and it turned out kids are natural entrepreneurs. She said,  "During the brainstorm in the focus group, the girls came up with the idea of a Pet Adoption website." Holloway liked the idea. He said, "When I was a kid, of course, I tried to start my own entrepreneurial ventures but you know technology has changed since then, there are more resources available. Maybe building a website can help to further their goals of what they want to achieve at a younger age."
 +
 +  Queathem has big plans for Savvy Kids. There are infinite directions this program could go based on the variety of technologies available.  She said, "I want every single student to have the desire to continue after the first seven week course. I want them, once they try it,  to not want to stop."

The next session of Savvy Kids begins Saturday, April 15. Savvy Coders is hosting its second free "Coding Fair" for Savvy Kids on Saturday, April 15 at SketchPad co-working space at 930 Kehrs Mill Road from 10:00 AM to Noon. Attendees receive $50 off tuition for the seven week program.
