                    <p>All classes are held at <a class="locationLink" href="http://refinerynashville.com"><span class="location">the Refinery</span></a> in <span class="city">Nashville</span>. Besides being a warm and inviting location, it also smells of leather-bound books and rich mahogany.</p>

                  <div class="response" id="faq2">
                    <p>Generally, classes will be held Monday-Friday from 6pm-9pm.<p>
                    <p>Sometimes, though, holidays happen. So there is always a chance that hours will be modified in some way.
                      We have 60 hours of materials to cover,
                      and we're committed to making sure that all class times do not conflict with working hours.
                     This may mean that classes will be held on Saturday to make up for lost time.
                     All schedules will be officially sent out to students before classes start.</p>

                    <p>You need a laptop that's able to run a modern browser.
                    It can be Mac, Linux, or Windows... just no Chromebooks, please. And that's it!</p>

                  <div class="response" id="faq6">
                    <p>Class materials from Savvy Coders are the product of a team effort!
                    The framework for the class comes from one of the nation's top full-time bootcamps.
                    Our curriculum partner has a 99% placement rate for full-time JavaScript developers,
                    with an average starting salary of $105,000/yr. We've worked together to
                    create the introductory course that we're offering in Nashville for those folks
                    that aren't yet ready for full-time programs.</p>
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3 id="q7">Is this class for me?</h3>
                  <div class="response" id="faq7">
                    <p>Probably! If you can type, have your own laptop, and are excited by the idea
                      of 60hrs of guided technology work, then you've come to the right place.</p>
                    <p><b>No previous programming experience is required.</b></p>
                    <p>
                    This course is for folks that work during the day or aren't yet ready to commit to a full
                    career change into software engineering. You will, however, be ready to build a killer website,
                    display your work in a public portfolio, and understand the front-end of web development.
                    All of these things will make you a top candidate with the best bootcamps in <span class="city">Nashville</span>
                    and around the country if you choose to pursue programming as a career.</p>

                  <h3 id="q8">Is financial aid available?</h3>
                  <div class="response" id="faq8">
                    <p>Not at the moment. But we have priced the class such that a graduate would be able
                    to easily cover the cost of tuition by doing freelance web development for local small businesses.
                    With a going rate of $1000 per website for many single-page solutions,
                    the class should pay for itself (and then some!) with just two post-graduation projects.</p>

                  <div class="response" id="faq9">
                    <p>No, we don't. We offer something better, though: a project-filled portfolio that
                    demonstrates your skills better than any piece of paper ever could.</p>
